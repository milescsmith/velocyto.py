# E127, E128 are hard to silence in certain nested formatting situations.
# E265, E266 talk about comment formatting which is too opinionated.
# E402 warns on imports coming after statements. There are important use cases
# like demandimport (https://fburl.com/demandimport) that require statements
# before imports.
# E501 is not flexible enough, we're using B950 instead.
# E722 is a duplicate of B001.
# P207 is a duplicate of B003.
# W503 talks about operator formatting which is too opinionated.
# E203 conflicts with Black
